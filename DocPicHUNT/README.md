This folder contains the source code for the DocPicHUNT hack, that intends to find the relevent articles and images and allows cross paradigm navigation.
The Image part was done by extracting the SIFT features and building a classifier.(MATLAB code)
The image is referenced with the generated library and the tags for the best match are generated in a text file. And so problem is reduced to text articles.
Text articles were processed through TFIDF features.(Pythin code)
