Rupee is constantly galling against dollar. Recents trend signify that it won't be much late before it reaches to 70. U.S. dollar banknotes are printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. The leeuwendaler was authorized to contain 427.16 grains of .750 fine silver and passed locally for between 36 to 42 stuivers. It was lighter than the large denomination coins then in circulation, thus it was more advantageous for a Dutch merchant to pay a foreign debt in leeuwendalers and it became the coin of choice for foreign trade.
