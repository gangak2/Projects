An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research.

Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled.
First attested in English in the late 19th century (prior to the first sustained powered flight), the word airplane, like aeroplane, derives from the French aéroplane, which comes from the Greek + either Latin planus, "level",[2] or Greek (planos), "wandering".[3][4] "Aéroplane" originally referred just to the wing, as it is a plane moving through the air.[5] In an example of synecdoche, the word for the wing came to refer to the entire aircraft.
