Every face tells a story - from elation to tragedy, from hope to desolate loss, from innocence to wisdom, from anger to joy, and everything else in-between. No matter where we live in the world, or where we are born, or the circumstances we grow up in, we share the capacity for similar feelings.

Photographs of people have a remarkable power to capture something vivid and alive about the human spirit, and to say more than words ever could. When we see such photographs, it is in our nature to be curious, to try and empathise with others in circumstances we can barely imagine, and to try and read the emotions that make up the lives of those distant to us.

Human face

The front of human head is called the face and includes several distinct areas.[1] The main features are:

    The forehead is the skin beneath the hairline, bordered at the sides by the temples and eyebrows and ears.
    The eyes sit in an orbit and are protected by eyelids, which are sometimes visible, and eyelashes.
    The human nose shape is distinctive as are its nostrils and septum.
    The cheeks cover the maxilla and jaw, the extremity of which is the chin.
    The mouth, with the upper lip divided by the philtrum, sometimes reveals the teeth, which form a distinct pattern.

Facial appearance is vital for human recognition and communication. Facial muscles in humans allow expression of emotions.

The face is itself a highly sensitive region of the human body and its expression may change when the brain is stimulated by any of the five senses: touch, temperature smell, taste, hearing, and visual stimuli.[2]
