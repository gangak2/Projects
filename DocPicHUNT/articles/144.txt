\n                                            The fire has burned more than 125,000 acres, destroyed nine structures and is threatening the power supply of San Francisco. Officials say 4,500 additional structures remain in its path.

Last Saturday, he was in the northwestern corner of the park.\r\n\"I was on one side of the Tuolumne Canyon and on the other rim, there was a deep V between two peaks and a fire on each side. They joined and made a ring. People were pulling over to the side of the road to watch,\" said Molnar, who works in the wilderness center at Yosemite's Curry Village.\r\nEven at that moment, he said, watching what he suspects was a double lightning strike, he had a premonition that he would have to flee his house. On Friday afternoon, with the fire line about 2½ miles from his house, he hauled out the bookcase made by his grandfather and grabbed a coat rack saved from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fires.\r\n\"I watched that ring of fire and it was 'Holy. Holy,' \" he said. \"I know snowpack has been at 70% of normal for two years. I know that wood is as dry as what you would buy at a lumber store. And this was on a double-sided peak that no one could get to.\"\r\nGov. Jerry Brown on Friday night extended a state of emergency to include the city and county of San Francisco because of the threat to utilities.\r\nPHOTOS: Rim fire rages near Yosemite\r\nThe governor’s declaration said the wildfire has caused damage to electrical infrastructure serving San Francisco.\r\nThe San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has been forced to shut down transmission lines, and the city and county could face further damage to water and electrical assets, which could result in the interruption of those services, according to the governor's declaration.\r\nLarry Brown, who was volunteering for the Tuolumne County Sheriff's Department, said the Rim fire was \"coming in at a close second\" to a rash of wildfires that scorched hundreds of thousands of acres throughout the state in 1987.\r\nFour firefighters died battling those blazes, including one in the Stanislaus National Forest who was crushed by a falling tree. Tuolumne County was among the hardest-hit areas.\r\nALSO: \r\nInteractive: Rim fire near Yosemite\r\nRaging Rim fire crosses into Yosemite National Park\r\nFormer assemblyman files papers to fill Bob Filner's mayoral seat\r\nMarcum reported from Groveland.
