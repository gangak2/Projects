\n                                            But undercover Los Angeles police officers, patrolling a vigil in Pico-Union, say they considered the 37-year-old a threat to their lives. Earlier this month, police shot and killed Chavez after he allegedly removed a blue steel revolver from his waistband.\r\nChavez's friends and family say they still don't understand how that could have happened.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        HOMICIDE REPORT: Track killings in L.A. County\r\n\"They killed a good man,\" said Zizis Carrillo, who lives at the Mariposa Hollywood Apartments where Chavez worked.\r\nIt was a twist of fate that led Chavez to the 1800 block of West Pico Avenue on the night of July 16.\r\nInstead of working his usual security shift, Chavez, a reformed gang member, decided to stop by the memorial for an old friend to show support for the man's family.\r\nLAPD officials said undercover gang officers also decided to monitor the vigil for Jesus Vargas, 27, who was fatally shot inside a nearby Jack in the Box on July 1.\r\nRoughly 150 people attended the memorial, with some spilling onto the sidewalk outside, recalled Elsis Garcia, the church pastor.\r\nChavez's sister-in-law Kenia German said she believes Chavez, who was wearing black pants and a gray shirt, was leaving the vigil when he encountered the undercover officers just before 9 p.m.\r\n\"He was there at the wrong place at the wrong time,\" German wrote in an email to the Times.\r\nDetails of the shooting remain under investigation, including what communication took place between the undercover officers and Chavez immediately before the shooting. LAPD Cmdr. Andy Smith said police recovered a gun at the scene.\r\nA law enforcement source said a security video showed Chavez pointing a gun.\r\nFriends of Chavez say he would draw a weapon only to inform officers that he was armed or if he felt endangered by the plainclothes detectives in an unmarked car.\r\nBy all accounts, Chavez dedicated himself fully to his security position, patrolling the area and befriending those in the apartment and neighborhood.\r\nHis small acts of kindness added up. When one resident went out of town, Chavez helped look after his pet fish. When older women arrived late at the bus stop, he would go outside and watch for their return. One time, he saw a suspicious man hiding by the apartment and calmly requested that he leave the premises and stay safe, building manager Dorcy Faucedo said.\r\n\"He was a person that would try always to advise you for the better, advise the good things in life,\" said Faucedo, whose refrigerator was covered with Post-It messages and drawings dedicated to Chavez. \"We do miss him very much.\"\r\nSeveral tenants said the building feels empty without Chavez. They miss stopping in the lobby to speak with him about everything from religion to politics to his prized Mustang car collection. Well-informed , he always had a book on hand.\r\nChavez always arrived an hour early for work. He meticulously recorded everything that happened during his shift from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m., writing in neat, capital letters that slanted the exact same degree to the right.\r\nOn July 11, a garage light needed fixing. On July 15, the day before his death, the elevator was broken.\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n
