\n                                            The Free Speech Coalition, a Canoga Park-based trade organization for the adult film industry, said Thursday that a 28-year-old actress who uses the screen name Cameron Bay, tested conclusively positive for HIV.\r\nThe coalition had issued the moratorium a day earlier, after preliminary test results came up positive.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        While the industry association maintained there was no evidence that Bay had contracted the virus on set, the scare added fuel to an ongoing legal battle over a Los Angeles County measure passed by voters last year requiring porn actors to wear condoms at work.\r\nMark Schechter, owner of Adult Talent Managers L.A., which represents Bay, told the Los Angeles Times that the actress went in for her regular screening for sexually transmitted diseases on Monday and the results came back inconclusive. She had a second test Tuesday with a new blood sample. Preliminary results came back Wednesday as potentially positive for HIV.\r\nThe Free Speech Coalition said Thursday that separate tests by Cutting Edge Testing and Talent Testing Services confirmed the result.\r\nBay's last test prior to Monday -- which was negative -- took place July 27, Schechter said, and she had done shoots since.\r\nSchechter said Bay was “distraught,” but was cooperating with medical personnel to make sure her partners were notified as quickly as possible.\r\n“As difficult as this news is for me today, I am hopeful that no other performers have been affected,” Bay said in a statement. “I plan on doing everything possible to assist the medical professionals and my fellow performers. Following that, my long-term plan is to take care of myself and my health.”\r\nA positive HIV test can be a double blow in that it leaves an adult performer out of a job while faced with costly medical treatment.\r\n“There’s no health insurance, there’s no union, there really isn’t a safety net,” said Aurora Snow, a recently retired adult film actress. “I feel really bad for her. It’s got to be really tough to get that kind of news.”\r\nOfficials with the county’s department of public health confirmed that the agency had been notified of the test result, as required by law, but did not respond to a query whether they were conducting any follow-up investigation to see if the condom mandate had been violated.\r\nA spokesman for Cal/OSHA, the state agency overseeing workplace safety issues, said the agency was gathering information about the case but had not opened a formal investigation.\r\nThe most recent industry moratorium related to a sexually transmitted disease was issued in August 2012 as a result of a syphilis outbreak.\r\nA previous HIV scare that shut down adult film production in 2011 turned out to be a false alarm. After a weeklong filming moratorium, the performer involved was retested, with a negative result.\r\nBefore that, performer Derrick Burts tested positive in 2010. Burts went on to become an advocate of requiring condom use in porn productions. He said Friday that he felt sympathy for Bay and commended her for coming forward publicly.\r\nBut he had harsh words for the industry. The Free Speech Coalition said there was “no evidence whatsoever” that Bay had contracted the infection on set -- a statement Burts said was “jumping the gun” because testing of other performers was ongoing.\r\n“To me, what that says is they care more about saving face,” Burts said. “They care more about the politics, not the performer.”\r\nThe Free Speech Coalition said it was working with a doctor affiliated with Adult Production Health and Safety Services to contact and treat any other performers who might have been exposed. The coalition said the moratorium would remain in place until all of Bay’s sexual partners have been tested and cleared.\r\nBecause of the rigorous APHSS protocols, the situation was accessed quickly and — most importantly — action was taken to ensure the protocols were followed,” coalition Chief Executive Diane Duke said.\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n
