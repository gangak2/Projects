In professional wrestling, a face or babyface (in British wrestling traditionally referred to as a blue-eye, and in Lucha libre faceo or t√©cnico) is a character who is portrayed as a hero relative to the heel wrestlers, who are analogous to villains.[1] Not everything a face wrestler does must be heroic: faces need only to be cheered by the audience to be effective characters. The vast majority of wrestling storylines place a face against a heel.

Traditional faces are classic "good guy" characters who do not break the rules, follow instructions of those in authority such as the referee, are polite and well-mannered towards the fans, and often overcome the rule-breaking actions of their heel opponents to cleanly win matches.[citation needed] While many modern faces still fit this model, other versions of the face character are now also common.[further explanation needed] A good example would be Stone Cold Steve Austin. While clearly not a championer of rule following nor submission to authorities, he was still regarded the face in many of his duels (such as the one with Vince McMahon).

The portrayal of face wrestlers changed in the 1990s with the birth of Extreme Championship Wrestling, the start of World Championship Wrestling's nWo storyline, and The Attitude Era of the World Wrestling Federation.[citation needed] During this time, wrestlers like Stone Cold Steve Austin and Sting used tactics traditionally associated with heels but remained popular with the fans.[citation needed] Although wrestlers such as Dick the Bruiser, Crusher and Freddie Blassie had been faces while using such tactics well before this, the Attitude Era is usually credited with this new kind of face.[citation needed]
Conversely, Kurt Angle was introduced to the then-World Wrestling Federation with an American hero gimmick based on his gold medal win at the 1996 Summer Olympics. He presented himself as a role model and stressed the need to work hard to realize one's dreams.[citation needed] Although such a personality appears appropriate for a face wrestler, Angle's character was arrogant and constantly reminded people of his Olympic glory, behaving as if he thought he was better than the fans.[2] Angle's character served as a meta-reference to how wrestling had changed. Although his character was intended to be a heel and behaved accordingly, some commentators speculated that if Angle attempted to get over as a face using a more heroic version of the same character, he would have failed. Notably, Angle did not use any of these heroic mannerisms when playing a face character, instead acting as somewhat of an antihero with a few elements of the "lovable loser" character archetype.[citation needed]
