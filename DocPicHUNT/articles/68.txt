Allegedly, some of the songs on About Face were being composed by Gilmour when Waters began production of the Pink Floyd album, The Final Cut.[citation needed] Gilmour claims he requested Waters wait another month for Gilmour to complete his own material, but Waters felt he was "on a roll", and already had plenty of material to complete the album, a very personal project about his father's death in World War II, and the further victimization of those who survived it.[9] Waters, seeing Gilmour and Mason's lack of interest in the concept, offered to make The Final Cut as a solo album, but Gilmour and Mason still wanted a Pink Floyd album, of any kind, to sell. "[T]hey know songs don't grow on trees," Waters told David Fricke of Rolling Stone magazine. "They wanted it to be a Floyd record" Songs of Gilmour's that are said[by whom?] to be of the pre-Final Cut period are "Murder", "Out of the Blue", "Near the End" and the musical orchestration for "Love on the Air" and "All Lovers are Deranged".[citation needed] Why Gilmour withheld those last two songs for possible inclusion on The Final Cut, when they had no lyrics (until later, when Pete Townshend got involved), is unknown.

Gilmour was later interviewed by Texas-based DJ Redbeard, on the radio programme, In the Studio with Redbeard during which the focus was his 2006 solo effort On an Island. He commented on About Face saying, "Looking back on it, it has some great moments on there but the whole flavour of it is too '80s for my current tastes."
