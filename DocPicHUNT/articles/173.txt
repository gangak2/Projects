\n                                            “Come on down and drink something other than Russian vodka!” said Brian Rand, an accountant at Eleven Bar & Nightclub, a gay bar on Santa Monica Boulevard.\r\nEleven stopped selling Stoli and all Russian vodka products Wednesday night, Rand said, with the enthusiastic support of its customers.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        In a statement on its Facebook page, Revolver Video Bar, also on Santa Monica Boulevard, announced Thursday that it, too, would boycott all Stoli products “effective immediately.”\r\n“Revolver Video Bar could not support any brand associated with Russia at a time when the Russian government is implementing its anti-gay law that bans gay ‘propaganda,’” the bar said in its Facebook statement.\r\nRussian President Vladimir Putin recently signed legislation banning “propaganda of nontraditional sexual relations,” including providing children with information on homosexuality and holding gay pride events. In June, the bill was overwhelmingly passed by Russia’s parliament.\r\nHuman rights activists say the law has encouraged hate crimes against gays and lesbians and that attacks against gay people are increasing.\r\nPutin also recently signed a law banning gay adoptions.\r\nWest Hollywood bars join a growing number of U.S. gay bars boycotting Stoli. Numerous Chicago bars have boycotted the vodka and other Russian products, according to the Windy City Times, a Chicago newspaper that focuses on the gay and lesbian community.\r\n“Consumer action, for a long time, has been a part of any activism,” Art Johnston, the co-owner of the gay bar Sidetrack Chicago, said in an interview with the Los Angeles Times.\r\nSidetrack--in Chicago’s Boystown neighborhood, an LGBT hub–stopped selling Stoli earlier this week, Johnston said. The spaces on the bar where Stoli vodka bottles would sit remain empty so people will ask what used to be there, he said.\r\n“I’m hopeful people will talk about this,” Johnston said. “Either the lives of gay and lesbian people in Russia mean something, or they don’t. Clearly, to us, they mean something.”\r\nThe CEO of the SPI Group, which owns the Stolichnaya Vodka brand, responded to the boycott in an open letter “to the LGBT community” on Thursday.\r\n“Stolichnaya Vodka has always been, and continues to be a fervent supporter and friend to the LGBT community,” Val Mendeleev wrote in the letter.\r\nThe Stoli brand, he wrote, has no ties to the Russian government and is privately owned by SPI Group, headquartered in Luxembourg. The vodka, he wrote, is made from Russian ingredients.\r\n“We fully support and endorse your objectives to fight against prejudice in Russia,” Mendeleev wrote. “In the past decade, SPI has been actively advocating in favor of freedom, tolerance and openness in society, standing very passionately on the side of the LGBT community and will continue to support any effective initiative in that direction.”\r\nWest Hollywood is home to a large lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender population – about 40% -- and a large population of immigrants from countries of the former Soviet Union, who make up 11% of the city’s population, according to a recent city survey.\r\nRussian bakeries and stores line Santa Monica Boulevard -- as do gay bars. Public notices in City Hall, which has a rainbow flag flying outside, are in English and Russian.\r\nTodd Barnes, the general manager of the Abbey, a gay bar on Robertson Boulevard, said he has received numerous emails from customers asking him to ban Stoli.\r\nHis bar, though, didn’t sell it. If it did, he would have pulled it off the shelves immediately.\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n
