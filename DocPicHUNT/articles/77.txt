What is now the United States Soccer Federation was originally the United States Football Association, formed on April 5, 1913. On April 5, 1913, the AAFA reorganized as the United States Football Association (USFA), presently known as the United States Soccer Federation. FIFA quickly granted a provisional membership and USFA began exerting its influence on the sport. This led to the establishment of the National Challenge Cup, which still exists as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, that fall. The National Challenge Cup quickly grew to overshadow the American Cup. However, both cups were played simultaneously for the next ten years. Declining respect for the AFA led to the withdrawal of several associations from its cup in 1917. Further competition came in 1924 when USFA created the National Amateur Cup. That spelled the death knell for the American Cup. It played its last season in 1924.

During the days of the American Soccer League, the league was seen as widely popular, and considered to be the second most popular sports league in the United States, only behind Major League Baseball.[citation needed] However, the "soccer war" between the USFA and ASL, combined with the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, led to the demise of the ASL in 1933, and the demise of the sport in the United States, entering a prolonged time of obscurity.

The prominence of college soccer increased with the NCAA sanctioning an annual men's soccer championship, beginning in 1959 with the inaugural championship won by St. Louis University.

Two professional soccer leagues were started in 1967, the United Soccer Association and the National Professional Soccer League, which merged to form the North American Soccer League in 1968. The NASL enjoyed a significant boost in popularity when the New York Cosmos signed Pele to play for three seasons from 1975-77. The Cosmos drew large publicity throughout the late 1970s. Between 1977 and 1980, the N.Y.Cosmos drew crowds of more than 60,000 on ten occasions, and over 70,000 on seven occasions.[9] The NASL declined during the early 1980s and disbanded in 1984.

In 1967 there were 100,000 people playing soccer in the US; by 1984, that number had grown to over 4 million.[10] Girls high school soccer experienced tremendous growth in playing numbers throughout the 1970s and 1980sâ€”from 10,000 in 1976, to 41,000 in 1980, to 122,000 in 1990.[11]
