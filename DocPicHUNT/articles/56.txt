Following a victory at Ravenna, the family of Francesco Baracca, a World War I fighter pilot for the Italian air force, presented him with a small charred plaque. Baracca had died in combat and the plaque was one of the surviving remnants of his plane. It contained their family crest, a black horse on a yellow shield. This prancing horse became the symbol of Ferrari and it appeared on all the cars he drove.

Even today it can be seen on the distinctive red racing Ferraris and the touring cars he makes for the public. The Ferrari has been featured in many films and television shows. The Ferrari 250 GT California was seen in “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off,” the Ferrari 512 was in the 1971 film “Le Mans” with Steve McQueen, the Ferrari “Mondial” was in Weird Science, the Ferrari Daytona appeared in “Miami Vice” and a replica of the Ferrari F430 was used in the Pixar movie “Cars.”

In a truly extraordinary and record-setting partnership between man and machine, Michael Schumacher and Ferrari dominated the Formula One races, winning the World Driver’s Championship from 2000 through 2004 and the Constructors’ Championship from 1999 through 2004. Among four wheelers, it is simply the ultimate in style and power and that is why it is my dream car.
