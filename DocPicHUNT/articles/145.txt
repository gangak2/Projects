\n                                            In other words, writers should not clutter a narrative with distractions that don't lead anywhere.\r\nBut in recent years historians and exhibitions staff at the Autry National Center of the American West have asked themselves whether the Griffith Park museum's gun displays met a test comparable to the one posed by the great Russian dramatist.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        The Autry deals with the history, landscape and culture of the West, including exhibits about the frontier days and their depiction on film and television.\r\nPHOTOS: Arts and culture in pictures by The Times\r\nIn that context, was it using firearms responsibly? Were they there just for show and the thrill that attaches to any implement of destruction — especially if it's associated with someone famous or is beautifully crafted, as is much of the Autry's firearms collection?\r\nOr did the museum deploy guns purposefully, in ways likely to help museum-goers learn about the history of the West?\r\nMuseum insiders weren't the only ones wondering.\r\n\"We get comments all the time,\" said Jeffrey Richardson, the Autry's curator of Western history, popular culture and firearms. \"Many people appreciate that we're looking at firearms through a historical lens. Others are critical. They've asked, 'Why put firearms on display at all?'\"\r\nRichardson said he has kept the gun critics fully in mind over the past few years while developing the museum's newest permanent installation, the Gamble Firearms Gallery, which opened in July. The need to come up with good answers grew more intense last December after the elementary school shooting in Connecticut.\r\nFULL COVERAGE: 2013 Spring arts preview\r\n\"After a tragedy like Newtown, you have to ask yourself, 'What are we doing, why are we doing it, and why is it appropriate?'\"\r\nIn a recent tour of the Gamble gallery and the nearby Greg Martin Colt Gallery, Richardson showed how the Autry's thinking has evolved and said that the display of guns in some other areas of the museum is outdated and needs to be rethought and redone. That can't happen overnight, because it takes time and a good deal of money for a museum to research and install a new display.\r\nThe Colt Gallery features a collection of more than 100 guns the Autry has owned and shown since it opened in 1988, bought at far less than their market value from George Strichman, a former chairman of Colt Industries who had built an impressive private collection and wanted to share it with the public intact.\r\nRichardson, who came to the Autry in 2007, oversaw a complete reconfiguration of the gallery before it reopened two years ago with its current display. It traces the history of Samuel Colt's company and how its chief product, the Colt revolver, evolved.\r\nMany splendid examples have beautifully carved or embossed handles and gold- or silver-engraved barrels and cylinders. Some were originally given as gifts to U.S. presidents, a tradition for Colt (although sometimes interrupted) since Andrew Jackson received the first one. Samuel Colt's personal collection was left to the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn., by his widow, Elizabeth Hart Jarvis Colt.\r\nRichardson says the Autry gallery remains a legitimate exhibit that informs viewers about an interesting topic — the development from 1835 to the end of the 19th century of revolvers widely used in the West.\r\nBut if he had to do it over again today, the Colt Gallery would tell a very different story. What's lacking, he said, is the bigger historical picture. We see how the guns developed but not about who aimed them and with what intents, outcomes and consequences. Those questions figure to be answered this fall when Richardson's book, \"Colt: The Revolver of the American West,\" is published by Rizzoli, with pictures and accompanying essays on 100 key guns.\r\nThe bigger picture — and the wish to give good answers to those who question why the Autry shows guns at all — is reflected in the new Gamble Gallery.\r\nGeorge Gamble, a Napa vintner and rancher, and grandson of a Procter & Gamble founder, donated about 50 prime Western guns to the Autry. The new gallery augments his gifts with other guns from the museum's collection that help bring out the themes Richardson had in mind.\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n
