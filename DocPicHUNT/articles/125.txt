\n                                            Celebrity muscle is behind some mega-bucks Westside property turnarounds, part of a boom in the rapid buy-fix-resell mania known as flipping.\r\nActors Jeremy Renner and Kristoffer Winters have roughly two dozen house flips under their tool belts. They just sold an estate in Holmby Hills for $24 million. The Roaring '20s Art Deco-style mansion, which Winters dubbed the Reserve, is set at the end of a cobblestone driveway on two acres.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        Brad Blumenthal, who played Jerry Lewis in \"Pulp Fiction,\" and co-investor Leo Hauser have a contemporary compound they created in Hollywood Hills West listed for sale at $28.8 million. Set above the Sunset Strip, the sleek home and guest house make the most of their head-on city views.\r\nPHOTOS: Grandest pool around? Malibu has \r\nThe ranks of celebrity home flippers include Oscar-winning actress Diane Keaton, \"L.A. Law\" actor Corbin Bernsen and his wife, actress-interior designer Amanda Pays, and \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\" star Jane Seymour, area real estate agents say. Other entertainers opt to invest in home flipping behind the scenes and let someone else do the work.\r\nFlipping activity is frenzied this year and not just among the famous.\r\nThe recovering real estate market has seen an increase in flipping at all price points, with the quick turnover of luxury properties nearly doubling since last year, according to DataQuick, a real estate information provider. In the $1-million-plus market, 5.3% of properties were flipped in the first six months of this year, compared with 3.4% during the first half of last year.\r\nIn the luxury niche, home flips typically require at least a year to complete, compared with six months in the overall market, said Jan Brzeski of Arixa Capital Advisors, which provides funding for homes in prime locations being renovated for resale. The flippers he works with typically see profits in the 12% to 20% range, he said.\r\nStars who are also flippers have the added advantages of a built-in publicity hook, an established network of contacts and unique insight into the taste of the well-heeled Hollywood crowd.\r\nStill, most celebs prefer to stick to their day jobs rather than put millions of dollars at risk.\r\n\"There are not a whole lot who are playing at this level,\" said real estate broker Billy Rose of the Agency, who is one of the listing agents for the Sunset Strip compound. Those who dare, he said, often want to make an architectural statement as well as money.\r\nThat would describe the Renner-Winters team, who began flipping houses as a way to survive between roles and now specialize in dramatic houses.\r\n\"As an actor starting out, you can have so much free time on your hands,\" Winters said. \"I used to have the nicest apartments and people would say, 'Hey, can you help me out?'\"\r\nREAL ESTATE: A star architect to celebrities\r\nRenner and Winters, who were both in the Oscar-winning film \"The Hurt Locker,\" started flipping a dozen years ago, turning around a $600,000 house in the Nichols Canyon area for $900,000.\r\n\"We didn't have any clue as to what we were doing,\" Winters said of the first flip. \"But we made a really nice chunk of change.\"\r\nThey sunk the profits into another house and another, often living in the homes they were renovating early on, he said. \"We would sleep on the sofas.\"\r\nThe challenge and artistic outlet has proven a fit for their talents. Winters likens the flipping process to \"figuring out the Rubik's Cube on how I can make this house flow better.\"\r\nThey have sold most of their homes furnished, which meant settling in the next place and starting from scratch â€” sometimes without power or water, Winters said. \"My office used to be in an SUV.\"\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n
