The basic components of laptops function similarly to their desktop counterparts, but are miniaturized, adapted to mobile use. The design bounds on power, size, and cooling of laptops limit the maximum performance of laptop parts compared to that of desktop components.[24]

The following list summarizes the differences and distinguishing features of laptop components in comparison to desktop personal computer parts:[25]

    Central processing unit (CPU): Laptop CPUs have advanced power-saving features and produce less heat than desktop processors, but are not as powerful.[26] There is a wide range of CPUs designed for laptops available from Intel (Pentium M, Celeron M, Intel Core, Core 2 Duo) and Intel Atom; AMD (Athlon, Turion 64, and Sempron); VIA Technologies, Transmeta and others. On non-x86 architectures, Motorola and IBM produced the chips for the former PowerPC-based Apple laptops (iBook and PowerBook). Most laptops have removable CPUs, although the motherboard may restrict the processor to the specific models, limiting the processors that are compatible.[27] Some laptops use a desktop processor instead of the laptop version and have high performance gains at the cost of the potential for overheating problems, and less battery life. In other laptops the CPU is soldered on the motherboard and is non-replaceable.

Memory (RAM): SO-DIMM memory modules that are usually found in laptops are about half the size of desktop DIMMs.[25] They may be accessible from the bottom of the laptop for ease of upgrading, or placed in locations not intended for user replacement such as between the keyboard and the motherboard. Currently, most mid-range laptops are factory equipped with 3â€“4 GB of DDR2 RAM, while some higher end notebooks (usually mobile engineering workstations) feature up to 32 GB of DDR3 memory. Netbooks are commonly equipped with only 1 GB of RAM and generally only expandable to 2 GB, if at all, to keep manufacturing costs low.
