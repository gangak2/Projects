Air-travel has its own limitations. It is very costly. Only the rich can afford to travel by aeroplane. It is out of reach of common people. Besides this, air-travel is also dangerous. Whenever, there is some trouble in the machinery, or weather is not suitable, the plane may crash. Such accident proves fatal to the air traveler. As only the rich and the important persons travel by air, the loss in air accidents is of precious lives. Even the aeroplanes carrying the late Prime Minister Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, the late Sardar Patel and Ex-Prime Minister Moraji Desai were involved in trouble. The whole country waited restlessly for the news of their safety. Dr. Homi Bhaba, the renowned scientist of India, was killed in an air crash.

But in spite of these hazards of air-travel, man has not been deterred in his efforts. New types of air-planes are being introduced for air-travel. Air India International's entry into the jet age in 1960 opened a new chapter in air-travel in our country. Such jet planes re big and fast. They carry more than 260 passengers at a speed of 650 kilometer per hour and more. Recently, Air India has acquired Jambo Jets which can carry 360 passengers at a time, and which have a speed of 950 kilometer per our. Recently, a large number of our cities have been linked by aeroplanes and thus placed on the air-map of India. Air-shuttles are operated between these cities.

The tremendous and continuous progress made in recent years in speed, safety, passenger-comfort and convenience, is bound to make more and more people air minded. Air travel has brought with it new philosophies. Scientific progress is bringing about changes in he outlook of men. All these changes are certain to make the aeroplane more popular. The future of air-travel, in India and in other counties, is bright.
