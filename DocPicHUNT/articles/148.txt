It was lucky to catch the NCAA as it was suffocating under its own weight of paperwork and general ineptitude.\r\nIn any event, the news made Oregon instant national-title contenders.\r\nWhew Two: Johnny Manziel transferred out of Oregon. This was the greatest thing to happen to Oregon since Phil Knight.\r\nCould you have imagined the headache of Lyles AND Manziel under the same roof?\r\nIncredibly, Kelly had verbal commitments from Manziel and Marcus Mariota out of high school. Manziel ended up transferring to Texas A&M and Oregon was left with Mariota.\r\nIt may not have seemed like a great thing after Manziel won the Heisman Trophy last season, but Oregon fans are confident in thinking they got the better quarterback and person.\r\nMariota had a tremendous freshman season and his numbers could have been better had he not been pulled from so many lopsided victories.\r\nMariota not only completed 68.5% of his passes for 2,677 yards, he also averaged 7.1 yards per carry for 752 yards and five touchdowns.\r\nWith Manziel engulfed in off-season controversy in Texas, the \"boring\" Mariota said at Pac-12 media day, \"My main focus is to continue to get better with my team and look forward to the season.\"\r\nWhew Three: Kelly left for the Philadelphia Eagles and there was barely a ripple on the Willamette River. Everyone knew that day was going to come and that assistant Mark Helfrich was going to seamlessly get promoted from within.\r\nOne of Oregon's great strengths has been its seamless transitions. Helfrich is only the Ducks' fourth coach since 1977, following Rich Brooks, Mike Bellotti and Kelly.\r\nHelfrich isn't as East Coast edgy as Kelly, for sure, but the offense probably won't notice.\r\n\"We're going to talk the same, work the same, practice the same,\" Helfrich said.\r\nOregon loses only two starters from an offense that finished No. 2 in scoring last season at 49.5 points per game.\r\nMariota and junior multi-threat back De'Anthony Thomas should both be worthy Heisman candidates. Colt Lyerla is one of the league's biggest loads at tight end.\r\nNick Aliotti's always-underrated defense has to replace all-world Dion Jordan but should be particularly strong in the secondary, which returns all four starters.\r\nThe schedule has enough beef with a trip to Virginia and Tennessee coming to Eugene on Sept. 14, but Oregon should be 8-0 heading into the big Nov. 7 showdown at Stanford.\r\nTop 25 so far: 25.
