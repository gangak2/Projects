\n                                            Pete Sampras standing at the net, Andre Agassi at the baseline trying to get the ball past his greatest rival.\r\nChris Evert, dainty but cruelly clever in the backcourt, against Martina Navratilova, who moved forward, fast as a whip, knocking a volley that Evert lunged at or just missed, eliciting a squeak of frustration from Evert.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        Or John McEnroe, dancing on his toes, back and forth as Bjorn Borg stood at the back of the court and calculated the correct angle at which to whiz the ball past his rival — only to have McEnroe, with a flick of the wrist, gently drop the ball over the net, just in the spot where Borg couldn't reach it.\r\nBillie Jean King still volunteers to coach players and teach them to serve and volley. She urged Serena and Venus Williams to learn that most difficult part of the game but couldn't persuade either of them.\r\nAs the U.S. Open tennis tournament, the final major of the year, begins Monday, it's more likely viewers will see an American man win — a longshot — than see more than a handful of serve-and-volley points.\r\nThat part of the game is gone, possibly forever.\r\n\"I don't think it's ever coming back, I really don't,\" said Sampras, who won 14 Grand Slam events, second only to Roger Federer. \"It's difficult to learn to do, and it's hard to be successful with it at first, and kids and coaches don't like failure....\r\n\"You have to be a good athlete, have great hands and great feet. The shot itself is pretty easy, but you need good touch and an intuition as to where the ball is going to go. You need to know when to run slow, run fast. All that stuff has to be learned.\"\r\nLindsay Davenport, who won three Grand Slam events, agreed with Sampras. \"Yes,\" she said, \"that part of the game is gone and probably for good. I guess you should never say never, but I'd say never.\"\r\nDavenport, as did Sampras and as have many players over the last decade, said technology is part of the reason.\r\n\"Improvements in strings, in rackets, it's taken some of the purity out of the game,\" Davenport said. \"You need such great technique, precise footwork, great anticipation and good form that holds up under pressure. So many things go into serve and volley, and players aren't being taught to be so precise. They don't need to be.\r\n\"With the strings we have now, you can hit bad shots from the baseline and the ball still goes in. I find myself shaking my head sometimes wondering how a ball landed in.\"\r\nMcEnroe, considered by many to have been the best in the game at volleying, echoed Davenport. \"The better rackets is one thing, the strings; the courts are slower in general.\r\n\"If you've noticed, the U.S. Open courts play fairly quickly. It would be a perfect court for someone like Sampras or [Stefan] Edberg or myself to be able to do their thing on the quicker court.\r\n\"When I'm asked this question, it always makes me think back to when Wimbledon was all about serve and volley and Pete was winning, Boris [Becker] and Goran Ivanisevic.\r\n\"All of a sudden, the game became a baseline game, and Lleyton Hewitt was playing David Nalbandian. I would have bet everything, my house, that you would never see that type of tennis in the men's game where all the players are staying back. I would have lost my house.\r\n\"I think ideally the best tennis is when you have two different styles going at it. People enjoy that more.\"\r\nA couple of weeks ago, Li Na, seeded sixth at the Open, played top-ranked Serena Williams in Cincinnati. Before the match, Li told Pam Shriver, \"I'm going to serve and volley. I'm going to try something different.\"\r\nWilliams won; Li served and volleyed fewer than 10 times.\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n
