Anthony Bertagna said.\r\nOcampo was booked on suspicion of two counts of vehicular manslaughter, felony hit-and-run and being an unlicensed driver, Bertagna said.\n                                        \n                                            \n                                            \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        Ocampo was allegedly behind the wheel of a speeding black Audi that ran a stop sign and broadsided a blue Nissan making a left turn at the intersection of Cabrillo Park Drive and Fruit Street around 10:43 a.m. Friday.\r\nThe driver of the Nissan, Alejandro Bravo, 53, of Santa Ana, was pronounced dead at the scene. A passenger, Juan Jose Luna-Castro, 50, also of Santa Ana, was transported to Western Medical Center where he died of his injuries, authorities said.\r\nAfter the crash, Ocampo allegedly got out of his car and checked both the driver and passenger sides of the Nissan and then walked away while on his cellphone, Bertagna said.\r\nArriving officers saw Ocampo run into a condominium complex but after searching for two and a half hours were unable to locate him.  \r\nOcampo was identified as the registered owner of the Audi and is a gang member on probation, Bertagna said.\r\n“We had photos of him,” Bertagna said. “We conducted a lineup and witnesses identified Ocampo as the suspect who was driving the car when the collision occurred.”\r\nALSO:\r\nChris Brown calls D.A.
