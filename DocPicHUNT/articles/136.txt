\n                                            The victim this time was Delbert Belton, an 88-year-old World War II veteran who police say was beaten to death by two teenagers as he sat in his car outside an Eagles Lodge in Spokane, Wash.\r\nOn Thursday, news of Belton's death the day before had reached a few corners of the Internet.\n                                        \n                                        \n                                        \n                                        By Friday, the tragedy had struck a national chord.\r\nDrudge Report carried the the story at the top of its page. CNN’s Jake Tapper interviewed Belton’s daughter-in-law on \"The Lead.\" The Fox News program \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" touted special coverage of Belton’s death.\r\nNews outlets also reported that a 16-year-old boy had been arrested in connection with the killing and that authorities were seeking a second boy, also 16.\r\nAnd in multiple cities across the U.S., the hashtag #DelbertBelton was trending on Twitter.\r\nThe flurry of social media shares and conversations was significant in lifting the story from a local to a national scale.\r\nOne of the earliest – and most high-profile tweets regarding Belton’s death -- came from actor James Woods.\r\n\r\n#DelbertBelton. Please RT. Don't let him die without anyone caring.\r\n— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 23, 2013\r\n\r\nAfter coverage by national media outlets amped up, Woods thanked followers — and continued posting articles on Belton's killing, including a piece by Janna Brock that criticized the mainstream media for ignoring \"the rampant, calculated attack on whites by blacks that have occurred recently.\"\r\n\r\nIf we are ACTIVE, the MSM will eventually wither in influence. Social media will provide a voice to be HEARD http://t.co/exh3fEPyeH\r\n— James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 23, 2013\r\n\r\nBelton's killing prompted many comparisons to previous high-profile killings and responses to them, in particular, President Obama's response following the death of Trayvon Martin. \r\n\r\nDid you hear Obama condemn the murder of #DelbertBelton? of course not, he didn't say anything about it b/c victim was an old white man.\r\n— Wisdom for Women (@wisdomforwomen) August 23, 2013\r\n\r\nOthers noted the absence of civil rights activists' weighing in on Belton's death, implying hypocrisy or callousness on the part of the civil rights movement for neglecting to examine the circumstances surrounding the fatal beating.\r\n\r\n#DelbertBelton is looking to you Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson for the respect and concern you accorded Trayvon. What, Belton's not black?\r\n— David Garrison (@dlgarrison) August 24, 2013\r\n\r\nMany tweets compressed animosity toward President Obama and admiration for Belton's military career in one tweet, with racial tension operating as a subtext.\n                                    \n                                \n                                \n
