Fans sometimes boo face wrestlers despite the way they are promoted. Some reasons this may occur include repetitive in-ring antics, a limited moveset, a lengthy title reign, lack of selling his/her opponents' moves, or an uninteresting character. This often results in wrestlers who are supposed to be cheered receiving a negative or no reaction from the fans. The Rock, who initially wrestled as Rocky Maivia (November 1996 to August 1997), was depicted as a classic face, but the fans despised him.[3] His constant attempts to get the crowd on his side struck them as obsequiousness and made him even less popular.[citation needed] Ironically, The Rock would achieve widespread popularity among fans when he took heel turns, during which his attempts to humorously mock the crowd would often be met with cheers. John Cena has a history of receiving mixed reactions and even full heat from crowds despite being presented as a face, as although his actions may be synonymous with those of a face character, many fans feel that his character is stale or that his wrestling ability is not good enough for him to be thought of as highly as he is.

Some face wrestlers would often give high fives or give out their own personal merchandise while entering the ring before their match, such as t-shirts, sunglasses, hats, masks, etc. to the fans. Bret Hart was one of first superstars to make this popular as he would drape his signature sunglasses to a child in the audience. Rey Mysterio, who has been a face in WWE since his debut in that promotion, would go to any fan (mostly a child) in a Rey Mysterio mask and touch their head with his head for good luck before wrestling. Alberto del Rio, after turning face, drapes his signature scarf around a fan before entering the ring and John Cena always throw his shirts and caps before enter a match. Big Show would give his hat to a fan when he was a face.
