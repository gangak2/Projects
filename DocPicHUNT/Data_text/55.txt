I think that the invention of the car changed completely the way of living of many people.
At the beginning the cars were bought by few people because the cost was high and the most of world population was poor. Today this situation has totally changed: in the development countries all families have one car and a large number of them have two cars or more.
Nowadays cars are essential: many people use them to go to work every day and to travel on holiday. I think cars are one of the most important invention of the last centuries.
Unfortunately cars have caused some damage: nowadays we have many environmental problem and we breathe dirty air because of the their gases.
Cars have really changed the world but I hope they will be used with more responsibility. 

My dream car is the Ferrari. Ferrari has always been a symbol of speed and prestige and elegance. It has even been described as a ‘passion on wheels’. Owning a Ferrari means that you have arrived in style. But of course it is not easy. Only the very rich can even dream of owning a Ferrari. The Ferrari is the brainchild of Enzo Ferrari, an Italian who started his career as a small carmaker and soon took up car racing.

The 125 Sport was the first ever Ferrari motorcar. Enzo Ferrari did not intend to build road cars, when he formed the Scuderia Ferrari in 1929. He did this as a sponsorship for amateur drivers. After World War I, Ferrari became a driver on the Alfa-Romeo team.
