Soccer in the United States is governed by the United States Soccer Federation, commonly known as U.S. Soccer. The organization governs all levels of soccer in the country, including the national teams, professional leagues, and the amateur game. With over 13 million Americans playing soccer in the United States, soccer is the third most played team sport in the U.S., behind only basketball and baseball/softball.[1] The popularity of soccer in the U.S. has been growing since the 1960s and 1970s, and received a significant boost when the United States hosted the 1994 World Cup. In the United States, the sport of association football is mainly referred to as "soccer", as the term "football" is primarily used to refer to the sport of American football or its other gridiron-based variants.[2]

The highest professional soccer league in the U.S. is Major League Soccer (MLS), which began play in 1996. MLS initially fared poorly, leading to MLS folding two teams in 2002 for financial reasons. MLS has since rebounded, and grown to 19 teams today (16 in the United States and 3 in Canada) with further expansion planned. With an average attendance of over 18,000 per game, MLS has the third highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S.,[3] and is the seventh highest attended professional soccer league worldwide.[4]

Soccer fans also follow the U.S. national teams, in particular the World Cup, which is held every four years. The World Cup has become increasingly popular with U.S. TV audiences, with the 2010 World Cup final game drawing 24 million American viewers.[5] The men's national team has played in every World Cup since 1990, and the women's national team has twice won the World Cup.
