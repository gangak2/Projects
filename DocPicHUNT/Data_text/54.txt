It couldn’t have been a more of an everntful day. My father was working at Friendly Honda on Route 44 at the time, therefore he recived a low price on the "hoopty". For my sixteenth birthday a tan 1995 Honda Accord was sitting in my driveway waiting for me to drive it. Though it was slightly rusted over the right rear tire, I was grateful to even have a car to call my own at the age of Sixteen.
