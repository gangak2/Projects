The earliest automobiles recorded were actually steam engines attached to wagons. This was invented by Lee Dover in the late 1700's. The steam engines were heavy and therefore the wagon was slow and hard to control. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot was the first person to get into a motor vehicle accident when he crashed his wagon into a wall.

Some cars in the early 20th century were powered by electricity. They were slow and heavy and went out of use until the idea was revived late in the century.

The internal combustion engine changed the way automobiles were to be powered. The engine used either gasoline, diesel, or kerosene to work. When the gas is exploded in a cylinder it pushes the piston down and turns the wheel.
The first Benz Patent Motorwagen

Although many people tried to make a good car that would work well and sell well, people say that Karl Benz invented the modern automobile. He used a four-stroke type of internal combustion engine to power his"car". He began to sell his production vehicles in 1888.

In North America, the first modern car was made by the Duryea Brothers in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Duryea Brothers' car also won the first-ever car race in 1895, competing against cars made by Benz. The race was in Chicago, Illinois, and 53 miles long. Duryea then began production of the first commercial automobiles in 1896. That year they made 13 cars by hand in Springfield, Massachusetts.
