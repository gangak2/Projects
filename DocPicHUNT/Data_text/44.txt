The United States dollar (sign: $; code: USD; also abbreviated US$), also referred to as the U.S. dollar or American dollar, is the official currency of the United States and its overseas territories. It is divided into 100 smaller units called cents.

The U.S. dollar is the currency most used in international transactions and is one of the world's dominant reserve currencies.[15] Several countries use it as their official currency, and in many others it is the de facto currency.[16] It is also used as the sole currency in two British Overseas Territories, the British Virgin Islands and the Turks and Caicos islands.

The Constitution of the United States of America provides that the United States Congress shall have the power "To coin money".[17] Laws implementing this power are currently codified in Section 5112 of Title 31 of the United States Code. Section 5112 prescribes the forms, in which the United States dollars shall be issued.[18] Those coins are both designated in Section 5112 as "legal tender" in payment of debts.[18] The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar. The pure silver dollar is known as the American Silver Eagle. Section 5112 also provides for the minting and issuance of other coins, which have values ranging from one cent to fifty dollars.[18] These other coins are more fully described in Coins of the United States dollar.
