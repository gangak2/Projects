Even to-day horses and camels are commonly used to carry heavy loads and men from one place to another. Water transport has also assumed new importance. Huge ships now carry cargo and passengers over stormy seas. As man's needs multiplied and he tried to march ahead on the path of civilization, he had to make new inventions. Steam power was harnessed and steam engine was invented. Trains, thus, started running. Motor cars and buses began to ply on the roads. But man was not satisfied with all this. He wanted to fly in air like birds. He carved for wings. This desire led to the invention of aeroplanes. So, this is the latest model of travel.

The unique feature of air travel is the fact that men, goods and mail can move quickly from any point of the global air network to any other by ay combination of routes, on a single ticket valid everywhere. This is the result of a massive system of bilateral agreements between governments, pains-taking arrived at since the end of world War II.

Civil air transport in India dates back to 1932, when Tata Sons and National Airways began operation with light, single engine air-craft for carrying mail. At the end of World War II, the air service in India operated with advanced types of aircraft on a daily frequency basis and linked most of the important administrative centers. Due to financial difficulties, Civil Air transport was nationalized on August 1, 1953. All the companies were merged into a single body the Indian Airlines Corporation. Since then excellent progress has been made.

Life is becoming more and more busy People want to save time in every way. There is no way out for such persons other than the aeroplane. There is no obstacle in air travel as we find on roads. Air-travel is most comfortable.
